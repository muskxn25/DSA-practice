# Arrays and Strings

This folder contains solutions for array and string manipulation problems. Each solution is implemented in Python and includes problem descriptions, explanations, and test cases.

## Problems

1. **Two Sum**
   - Problem: Find two numbers in an array that add up to a target value
   - Solution: `two_sum.py`
   - Time Complexity: O(n)
   - Space Complexity: O(n)

2. **Valid Parentheses**
   - Problem: Check if a string of parentheses is valid
   - Solution: `valid_parentheses.py`
   - Time Complexity: O(n)
   - Space Complexity: O(n)

3. **Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters**
   - Problem: Find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters
   - Solution: `longest_substring.py`
   - Time Complexity: O(n)
   - Space Complexity: O(min(m, n)) where m is the size of the character set

## How to Use

1. Each solution file contains:
   - Problem description
   - Solution implementation
   - Test cases
   - Time and space complexity analysis

2. To run a solution:
   ```bash
   python <solution_file>.py
   ```

## Notes

- All solutions are implemented in Python 3
- Each solution includes comments explaining the approach
- Test cases are included to verify the correctness of the solution
