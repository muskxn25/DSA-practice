# 📚 Arrays and Strings

This folder contains detailed explanations and examples of array and string data structures.

## 📂 Contents

1. [Static Arrays](./StaticArrays/README.md)
   - Fixed-size arrays
   - Memory allocation
   - Basic operations

2. [Dynamic Arrays](./DynamicArrays/README.md)
   - Resizable arrays
   - Amortized analysis
   - Common operations

3. [Strings](./Strings/README.md)
   - String manipulation
   - Common operations
   - Implementation examples

## 🎯 Learning Path

1. Start with Static Arrays to understand basic array concepts
2. Move to Dynamic Arrays to learn about resizable data structures
3. Finally, explore Strings to understand character sequence manipulation

## 📝 Notes

- All examples are implemented in Python
- Each section includes time complexity analysis
- Code examples are provided with detailed comments
